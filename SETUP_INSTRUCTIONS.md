2. Click "Add New Service"
3. Choose your email provider (Gmail recommended)
4. Follow the instructions to connect your email
5. Note the **Service ID**

### Step 3: Create Email Template
1. Go to "Email Templates"
2. Click "Create New Template"
3. Use this template structure:

```
Subject: {{subject}}

From: {{from_name}}
Email: {{from_email}}

Message:
{{message}}
```

4. Note the **Template ID**

### Step 4: Get Your Public Key
1. Go to "Account" â†’ "General"
2. Copy your **Public Key**

### Step 5: Update Your Portfolio
Open `index.html` and replace:
```javascript
emailjs.init("YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"); // Line 718
```
